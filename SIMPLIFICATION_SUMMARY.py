SIMPLIFICATION SUMMARY
======================

OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED:
- Eliminated differences between Mini-Gold and Mini-White
- Unified code with universal protocol
- Removed unnecessary elements from the codebase
- System verified

MAIN SIMPLIFIED FILES:

SIMPLIFIED VERSION (RECOMMENDED):
- ble_scanner_clean.py      - Unified main scanner
- config_clean.py          - Simplified configuration
- battery_evaluator.py     - Independent CR2032 evaluator
- requirements_clean.txt   - Minimal dependencies
- run_scanner_clean.bat    - Simplified Windows menu
- README_clean.md          - Updated documentation
- test_system_clean.py     - Complete system tests

ORIGINAL VERSION (MAINTAINED):
- ble_scanner.py           - Original scanner (with type selection)
- config.py                - Original config
- requirements.txt         - Complete dependencies
- run_scanner.bat          - Original menu
- README.md                - Original documentation

SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS:

UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL:
- Auto-detects BLE data format
- Tries complex protocol (Mini-Gold) first
- If fails, tries simple protocol (Mini-White)
- No need to select device type

CLEAN CODE:
- Eliminated code duplication
- Unified logic for all devices
- Reduced dependencies
- Modular structure

FEATURES:
- Universal BLE scanning
- CR2032 battery evaluation
- Database traceability
- COM port detection
- Logging and results
- Windows menu interface

SIMPLIFIED CONFIGURATION:
- Edit config_clean.py for primary/backup COM port and thresholds

TEST RESULTS:
- All tests passed successfully in the simplified verification

NEXT STEPS:
1. To use simplified version:
   - run run_scanner_clean.bat and select option 3 (Run Scanner)
2. For development:
   - run test_system_clean.py to verify system
   - run battery_evaluator.py for evaluator demo
   - run ble_scanner_clean.py for direct scanner execution
3. For production:
   - Use *_clean.py files
   - Configure COM_PORT in config_clean.py

ADVANTAGES VS PREVIOUS VERSION:
- Reduced number of files
- No manual device type selection
- Single automatic protocol
- Cleaner code and easier maintenance

Status: SYSTEM READY FOR PRODUCTION
